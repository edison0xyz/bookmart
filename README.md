This project is developed for 95882 - Enterprise Web Development as a short project done over one week (three days actually due to my procarstination)


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js and npm](nodejs.org) Node >= 4.x.x, npm >= 2.x.x
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) (`npm install --global gulp`)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) - Keep a running daemon with `mongod`

### Developing

1. Run `npm install` to install server dependencies.

2. Run `mongod` in a separate shell to keep an instance of the MongoDB Daemon running

3. Run `gulp serve` to start the development server. The deployment page should appear automatically. If it doesn't, fire up your browser and go to http://localhost:3000

## Build & development
